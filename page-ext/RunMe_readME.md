/*********************
 RunMe Instruction
*********************/

RunMe will echo all data inside it back to the user and then start the webapplication.
You can echo your pass and username back for your convenience but it isnt neseccary and even carries a little risk.

the batch file runs the command "web-ext run" for you.
you can effectively make a link to the file so you can avoid the navigation to it.
